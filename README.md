# Tweet Generator

Tweet Generator is a Python script that generates random tweets using a Markov chain algorithm. Given a source text, the script analyzes the text to learn the probabilities of word transitions and then generates new tweets based on those probabilities.

##Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ayam04/Tweet-Generator.git
   ```

2. Open the `tweet_generator.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Run the notebook cell by cell to understand the implementation and execute the code.

4. Modify the source text by updating the `text` variable to use your own data for generating tweets. The more diverse and extensive the source text, the more interesting and varied the generated tweets will be.

5. Adjust the parameters as needed:
   - `n`: The order of the Markov chain. Higher values result in more coherent but less random tweets.
   - `num_tweets`: The number of tweets to generate.

6. Run the final cell to generate the tweets. The generated tweets will be printed in the output.

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the Tweet Generator:

- `numpy`: For generating random numbers and manipulating arrays.
- `nltk`: For tokenizing the text and generating n-grams.

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have a compatible Python environment set up.
